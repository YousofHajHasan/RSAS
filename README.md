# Welcome to My Project!

ðŸš€ Thank you for checking out my project. I'm excited to share more details with you soon. Stay tuned!

- The comprehensive README file is currently in the works and will be available soon.

## Things Covered in This Project

- **Real-time Multi-processing Locally for Multiple Cameras**: Utilizes multiprocessing to manage and analyze video feeds from several cameras simultaneously, enhancing real-time performance.

- **Sending Security Notifications by Tracking Objects**: Implements object tracking to send timely security notifications based on specific criteria.

- **Creating Logs for Data Analysis**: Generates detailed logs of the systemâ€™s operations, which are crucial for data analysis and improving system performance.

- **Skipping Mechanism to Keep the System Running in Real-time**: Incorporates a skipping mechanism that allows the system to maintain real-time processing by dynamically adjusting the handling of incoming video frames.

These features are designed to ensure that the system not only meets the real-time processing requirements but also remains robust and efficient in various operational scenarios.

- Here's a demo video to give you a glimpse of what's coming:
